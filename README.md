Machine learning analysis of NYC MTA subway performance using classification, regression, and clustering to evaluate customer journey time performance.

MTA Subway Performance Machine Learning Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway performance using machine learning techniques to better understand and predict customer journey outcomes. The focus of the project is Customer Journey Time Performance (CJTP), a rider-focused metric that measures whether passengers complete their journeys within five minutes of scheduled travel time.

Unlike traditional on-time performance metrics, journey-based metrics incorporate both platform wait time and onboard delays, providing a more realistic representation of passenger experience. Using these metrics, this project applies classification, regression, and clustering methods to identify performance drivers, predict operational outcomes, and uncover patterns across subway lines and divisions.

This project was completed as a final machine learning project by Rachael Gottbetter, William Kinum, and Kyle Tenczar.
